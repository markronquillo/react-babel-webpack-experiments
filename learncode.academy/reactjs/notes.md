## Tutorial 1

What I've learned:
- setup the basic reactjs application project structure by:
	- webpack.config.js
	- installing needed node.js plugins, like babel etc

## Tutorial 2

Component returns "exactly" one element

> Gotchas: you do not need to add a comma in declaring different functions inside a class
```

class Sample {

	method1() {
		
	}

	method2() {
		
	}

}
